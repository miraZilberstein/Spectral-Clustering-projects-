3 projects focusing on clustering algorithms:
1. K-means algorithm is a clustering method for finding a partition of N unlabeled observations into K distinct clusters. I implemented this algorithm in both Python and C.
2. K-means++ algorithm is a smart centroid initialization method for the K-mean algorithm. I implemented this algorithm in Python and integrated it with the K-means algorithm that was ported to a C extension using the C API.
3. a version of the normalized spectral clustering algorithm also using both C and Python.
